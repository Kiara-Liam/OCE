This Document outlines the xml structure and parameters which should accompany an animation set for OSA2

current version: 1.0a 25-8-18

Intentions:
a xml document should accompany any external animation set used by OSA2. This XML has to follow rules, so that it can be used by OSA2 to get 
the neccessary informations to handle the animations and act apropiatly. This means, that the xml needs to contain informations about the 
pack itself as well as for every single animation. Since OSA2 has a tag system for script access, each animation should also be tagged.
For a higher reusability of existing mods and easier integration of already existing and widely used mods, the current tag system contains 
mainly the SL tags, or at least compatibilty methods to read SL and change them internally to OSA2 tags. Where a change to SL tags is intended, 
it will be noted in the tags document.
XMLs go to Data/OSA2/

NOTE:
-> Aimation ID <ID>START</ID> is a hardcoded Animation in OSA2 and shouldn't be used by other animations.
-> Aimation ID <ID>END</ID> is a hardcoded Animation in OSA2 and shouldn't be used by other animations.
-> Use <ID>START</ID> in the <Pre>...</Pre> clause if your animation should be accessible from start, if animation graph is started at root
-> Use <Post id=END></Post> if the current OSA2 stage should exit automaticly after this animation 
-> if an animation is a paired animation, add 2 actor clauses and keep in mind to set creature tags accordingly (male and female are recognized tags)
